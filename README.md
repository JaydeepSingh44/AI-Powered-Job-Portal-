This project focuses purely on backend architecture and business logic. Frontend integration will be planned separately in Future.

Key Feature of my Core backend project :

   ->RESTful API architecture following industry best practices
   
   -> JWT-based authentication and authorization
   
   -> Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Admin, Recruiter, and Job Seeker roles
   
   -> Secure user registration and login with password hashing (bcrypt)
   
   -> Modular and scalable backend architecture (MVC pattern)
   
   -> MongoDB schema design with Mongoose ORM
   
   -> Job creation, update, deletion, and retrieval APIs
   
   -> Job application workflow with relational data handling
   
   -> Protected routes using middleware-based authorization
   
   -> Centralized error handling and custom API error responses
   
   -> Input validation and data sanitization
   
   -> Environment-based configuration using dotenv
   
   -> API-ready backend designed for frontend integration
   
   -> Clean, maintainable, and production-structured codebase
